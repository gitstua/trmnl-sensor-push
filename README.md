# TRMNL Sensor Push for Home Assistant

This Home Assistant integration pushes state changes for entities tagged with "TRMNL" to your TRMNL webhook endpoint.

This allows you to view the entity states in on your TRMNL device.

## Limitations
Because the e-ink display is optimized for long battery life, updates will be more than 15 minutes out of date typically.

## Installation

### HACS Installation
1. Add this repository to HACS as a custom repository
2. Install the integration through HACS
3. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation
1. Copy the `custom_components/trmnl_sensor_push` directory to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. In Home Assistant, go to Configuration → Integrations
2. Click "+ ADD INTEGRATION" and search for "TRMNL Sensor Push"
3. Enter your TRMNL webhook URL
   - This URL should look like: `https://usetrmnl.com/api/custom_plugins/AAAA-d000-4000-8000-000000000000`
   - You can get this URL from your TRMNL custom plugin settings

## Usage

1. Add the "TRMNL" tag to any entity you want to monitor
2. When the state of these entities changes, the new state will be pushed to your TRMNL webhook
3. Updates are rate-limited to once every 30 minutes per entity to prevent overwhelming the endpoint

## Troubleshooting

Check the Home Assistant logs for any error messages. Common issues:
- Invalid webhook URL
- Network connectivity problems
- Rate limiting (updates are limited to once every 30 minutes per entity)
- Ensure you have the integration enabled in Home Assistant
- Ensure you have the TRMNL label created and assigned to some entities in Home Assistant
